 * GraphManager is the core of this project. It contains all of the necessary functionality, and is the only file

 * 
 * GraphManager: 
 *	* Loads all utilities, including SDL and TTF
 *  * Contains SDL tools including the renderer and font(s), and cleans them when the program is closed
 *  * Describes the life of the program (if !active, the program will end)
 *  * Manages the TextEditor, and contains pointers to all Nodes
 *  * Handles events during runtime (user interaction such as keyboard or mouse inputs)
