/*
 * A config header file which includes constants used through this project. No constants are defined in the private
 * variables of a class, so any desired cosmetic modifications can be made using this file.
 * 
 * This also includes any common #includes, such as vector and string. The general rule of thumb is that some files will
 * have unique #includes, but if more than one has it I tried to locate those here instead. Every file in this project
 * should include "Config.h", unless there's no utility to be gained.
